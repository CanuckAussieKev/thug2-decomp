# Animation & skeleton / skinned model data (0x406460-0x41A6D0) - anim agent

Branch worktree-agent-a51ba86b0cf626a18. Tests in src/hook/selftests_anim*.cpp (kit: src/hook/anim_testkit.h).
Shared files touched: CMakeLists.txt (new files listed), src/game/mth/vector.cpp / vector.h (two functions added,
ProjectToPlane made exact).

- [x] Batch AN-1 (NOT run in the game yet; the task lists and two angle helpers):
  src/game/core/task.h / task.cpp (new), src/game/mth/vector.cpp.
  - Mth: 0x00406460 GetAngle (degrees between two vectors; x87: lengths, unit vectors and the dot product in
    double, the cosine rounded to a float and limited to [-1, 1]; the result in ST0 unrounded - returned as a
    double), 0x00406630 GetAngleAbout (radians from a to b seen along an axis: both projected onto the plane
    across it, signed by (axis x a) . b). Vector::ProjectToPlane (0x00406080, rewritten earlier) made exact: the
    original keeps the dot product and x's part along the normal in double - the rounded version gave visibly
    different angles for vectors nearly along the axis.
  - Tsk::BaseTask: 0x00406890 constructor (node allocated with the priority), 0x00406930 destructor, 0x00406980
    scalar deleting, 0x004068F0 Remove, 0x00406850 InList. Tsk::List: 0x00406A50 constructor, 0x00406A20
    destructor, 0x004069B0 MarkChanged, 0x00406A80 AddTask (the task's stamp set to the list's - 1: it runs in a
    pass going on), 0x00406AC0 Process (the first argument unused; a pass restarts from the top when tasks are
    added / removed, skipping those already run by their stamp; disabled tasks and those sharing a mask bit
    skipped; nothing while locked), 0x00406BB0 RemoveAllTasks. Tsk::StackList (List + its node): 0x00406D60,
    0x00406C30. Tsk::Stack: 0x00406E80 constructor (the mask at +0x04 left unset), 0x004070E0 destructor,
    0x00406DE0 Push, 0x00406FB0 Pop (a list popped while the stack runs waits in +0x1C until the pass ends; an
    empty stack / a failed allocation crash as in the original), 0x00406C90 AddTask (the current list),
    0x00406CB0 RemoveAllTasks, 0x004070A0 Process, 0x00406F10 DeletePoppedLists. The nodes', heads' and local
    searches' destructors: 0x00406A00 / 0x00406860 (Lst::Node<BaseTask>), 0x00406D00 / 0x00406D20
    (Lst::Node<StackList>), 0x00406E50 (Lst::Head<StackList>), 0x004069C0 / 0x004069D0, 0x00406CA0 / 0x00406CD0
    (the Lst::Search vtables).
  - Tests (selftests_anim.cpp): TestAnimAngles - 3000 random triples (zero, tiny (< 1e-30), huge, parallel,
    opposite, along the axis), compared to 1e-13 (the C runtime's acos differs from the game's in the last bit);
    TestAnimTasks - a stack of 10 tasks with recording callbacks that remove the next / a later task / themselves,
    add tasks, push and pop lists while the stack runs, over 11 passes; a lone list with masks and a lock; the
    destructors in and out of lists; a second stack popped unlocked and locked and destroyed with lists waiting;
    the node / head / search destructors on their own. Allocation and frees stood in for; in our run the game's
    vtables point at ours (as with the hooks in). Every call, allocation, free and the whole arena compared.
  - Mutations: 46 deliberate bugs; 45 caught (39 at first: the stack's state right after construction, a lone
    removal outside a pass, the next task removed during a pass, a node destructor's vtable, freeing with flag 1
    and vectors shorter than 1e-30 added for 6). The other one is equivalent: RemoveAllTasks marking the list
    changed (each Remove marks it already).
- [ ] Next: AN-2 - the asset types after 0x004071A0 (Animation, Cutscene, Node Array, Scene, SceneColl,
  Skeleton, skin, SkinColl, TexDict: 0x004071A0-0x0040AB00).
