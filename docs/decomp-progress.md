# Decompilation progress

Restart rule: continue the first batch not marked done. A batch is done when it builds cleanly and is committed
(one commit per batch). In-game testing happens later; a batch that breaks the game gets reverted by its commit.
Batches marked (untested) haven't been run in-game yet.

## Core utilities (0x401000-0x406460, 130 functions)

- [x] Batch 0: `Crc::GenerateCRCFromString` 0x401B90 (commit 55ac891)
- [x] Batch 1 (untested): 0x402320-0x402600 -> `Mth::Vector` + `Mth::Line` ctor (14 functions,
      `src/game/mth/vector.cpp`), with self-tests.
- [x] Batch 2 (untested): CRC buffer/extend (0x401AA0, 0x401BE0), `Mth::Matrix` copy + X/Y/Z rotation builders
      (0x404090, 0x404DD0-0x404E70), `Vector::operator-=` (0x406050), `Vector::ProjectToPlane` (0x406080).
      Skipped 0x401020: compiler-generated array-constructor helper, not game code.
- [x] Batch 3 (untested): `Util::BitStream` ctor/SetInputData/SetOutputData/GetByteCount/Flush
      (0x401050-0x4010C0, 0x401180), `Str::LowerCase`/`UpperCase` (0x402080, 0x4020B0), `Mth::Clamp` (0x4022C0),
      Vector(x,y,z) ctor (0x4022F0), Vector/Matrix `operator[]` (0x402310, 0x404080).
      Deferred until their callers are understood: 0x401D80 (assigns IDs from a global counter at 0x690FA0),
      0x403210 / 0x403220 (each zero one field of an unknown class).
- [ ] Batch 4+: the rest of the block, smallest first

## Notes
- Ghidra's pseudocode can be wrong for x87 float code: 0x4023A0 decompiled as an empty function but is
  `LengthSqr` (result left in ST0). Always read the disassembly for float functions.
- Float self-tests use a tolerance: originals run on x87, ours on SSE, so the last bits can differ.
- Member functions are replaced via `REPLACE(addr, &Class::Method)`; constructors via a small adapter that
  placement-news the object (see `LineAdapter` in vector.cpp).
