# Decompilation progress

Restart rule: continue the first batch not marked done. A batch is done when it builds cleanly and is committed
(one commit per batch). In-game testing happens later; a batch that breaks the game gets reverted by its commit.
Batches marked (untested) haven't been run in-game yet.

## Core utilities (0x401000-0x406460, 130 functions)

- [x] Batch 0: `Crc::GenerateCRCFromString` 0x401B90 (commit 55ac891)
- [x] Batch 1 (untested): 0x402320-0x402600 -> `Mth::Vector` + `Mth::Line` ctor (14 functions,
      `src/game/mth/vector.cpp`), with self-tests.
- [ ] Batch 2: heavily used leaves elsewhere in the block (0x401020, 0x401aa0, 0x401be0, 0x404090, 0x404dd0-0x404e70, 0x406050, 0x406080)
- [ ] Batch 3+: the rest of the block, smallest first

## Notes
- Ghidra's pseudocode can be wrong for x87 float code: 0x4023A0 decompiled as an empty function but is
  `LengthSqr` (result left in ST0). Always read the disassembly for float functions.
- Float self-tests use a tolerance: originals run on x87, ours on SSE, so the last bits can differ.
- Member functions are replaced via `REPLACE(addr, &Class::Method)`; constructors via a small adapter that
  placement-news the object (see `LineAdapter` in vector.cpp).
