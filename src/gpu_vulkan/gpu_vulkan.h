// expanded), vertex and index buffers, render targets, depth surfaces (D24S8, else D32S8), system-memory surfaces,
// copies and read-backs, occlusion queries, samplers - and the draws: pipelines from the state block, rendering passes
// inferred from the targets, the frames in flight, the present. app/ installs it with renderer=vulkan. No Vulkan header
